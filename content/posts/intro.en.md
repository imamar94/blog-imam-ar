## Introduction

*Since I lost my personal site previously along with the end of my free trial in GCP (and unfortunately I did not take any action on that!). Now **I made a new one!** Ehmm, so let me put short introduction as my first ever post here.*

Hello! I am Imam. Currently living and just moved in to Estonia, working in one of a start up here as a data analyst. Also since this is a new episode of my fresh life here (after a quite long journey in Japan), I re-started my personal site just for me to put my random thought and writing here. Probably sometime I will rant about stuff also :v:.

Thats it, very short indeed :wink:. I hope you will be sticking around to find out more interesting story here. See ya!
